# BASH UTILS

*A random collection of scripts I have written over the years*

## Installation

Simply clone this repository or download the scripts you need from this repository's 
[releases](https://github.com/theCalcaholic/bash-utils/releases).

Don't forget to set executable permissions (`chmod +x`). :)

If you cloned it, you can add the following line to your ~/.bashrc:

```sh
. /path/to/cloned/repo/bash_aliases
. /path/to/cloned/repo/bash_aliases_auto
```

That will give you bash aliases for all the scripts in the repo.
